Project: Heater
Author: Charlotte Pierce

This project is a simple heater. The heater can be created with a minimum and maximum
value of heat which it can hold. It can also become warmer or colder by a certain
amount, defined by the user (unless the calculation would send the value of the heater
to be outside the limits also defined by the user).

To use this application:
- create an instance of Heater, selecting two numbers for the minimum and maximum values
- set a value by which to increment the temperature of the heater using setIncrement (can be left with the default of 5 if desired)
- use the warmer() and cooler() methods
- use the getTemp() method to see how the temperature changes

This project demonstrates the use of conditional statements to keep a value within
certain boundaries. It is fully documented using javadoc style.
