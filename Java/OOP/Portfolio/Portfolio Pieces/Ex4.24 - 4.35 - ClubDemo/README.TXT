Project: Club Demo
Author: Charlotte Pierce

This project is material for the Object-Oriented Programming portfolio of
Charlotte Pierce.

This application simulates a club. The club can have a number of memberships.
The club can return the number of members in the club, the number that joined
in any given month, as well as adding members, and removing members (members
can be removed based on the month and year of their joining the club).

To use this application:
- create as many instances of Club as desired
- create as many instances of Membership as desired
- add each Membership to a club as desired
- use each method within Club and observe it's functionality
Alternatively, peruse the code of ClubDemo, which creates two
memberships and adds them to a club as a demonstration of the
Club and Membership classes.

This application demonstrates the use of collections within a project. It implements
all associated challenge exercises. It is fully documented using javadoc style.
