Project: Clock Display turned AFL Scoreboard with GUI
Author: Charlotte Pierce

This project is part of the material for the Object-Oriented Programming Portfolio 
of Charlotte Pierce.

To use this project, create an instance of class ScoreGUI using the main method within. 
The scores of each team can be modified with the use of the buttons on the GUI.

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented programming with its use of classes, each
of which represents one singular task. This demonstrates the principle of cohesion.
Each class also demonstrates the use of encapsulation, that is, the principle that
all information within the class regarding its implementation is hidden from other classes.

This project fulfils the criteria defined in the portfolio requirements, being the most
advanced version of the clock display that was requested. As such, it involves the use
of a Swing/AWT graphical user interface, which uses anonymous inner classes for the
purpose of event listening on each of the buttons.

The project has basic exception handling included, to catch errors such as numberdisplay
returning a null value rather than a string of text as required.
