Project: Ticket Machine
Author: Charlotte Pierce

This project is part of the material for the Object-Oriented Programming portfolio
of Charlotte Pierce.

This project is a simple ticket machine. The ticket machine offers the choice of three
possible ticket types ("short", "half-day" and "daily"), each of which has a different
cost associated (the value of 'price' is altered appropriately when a ticket type is
selected). The machine allows the user to insert an amount of money in order to pay
for their ticket. If the amount input is not enough, it displays a message and can refund
the user's money.

To use this application:
- create an instance of TicketMachine
- use the selectTicket method, and enter either 'short', 'half-day' of 'daily'
- insert some money (cents)
- attempt to print a ticket using printTicket()


This project demonstrates the use of standard conditional statements in the java
language. It is fully documented using the javadoc style.
