Project: Stock Demo
Author: Charlotte Pierce

This project is material for the Object-Oriented Programming portfolio of
Charlotte Pierce.

This application simulates a stock room. The stock room can have a number of products.
The stock room can add products, receive a delivery of that product, find a given
product within the stock room and return the quantity held of a particular product.

To use this application:
- create an instance of StockManager
- create as many instances of Product as desired
- add the products to the StockManager
- use the methods in StockManager and observe the functionality
Alternatively, create an instance of the StockDemo class, which
demonstrates some of this functionality. 

This application demonstrates the use of collections within a project. It also demonstrates
the use of an iterator. It implements all associated challenge exercises. 
It is fully documented using javadoc style.
