  Breadth-First Search - Searches for a solution using the breadth-first search method.
  Depth-First Search - Searches for a solution using the depth-first search method.
  Greedy Best-First Search - Searches for a solution by selecting the node with the lowest cost to the node. Uses the Manhattan Distance as a heuristic.
  A* (A Star) - Searches for a solution by selecting the lowest total cost calculated by adding the path cost with the cost to get from the node to the goal. Uses the Manhattan Distance as a heuristic.
  Custom 1 - Searches for a solution by selecting a completely random node from the fringe.
  Custom 2 - Searches for a solution by selecting the node with the lowest total cost. Uses a custom informed heuristic which calculates the sum of the number of tiles out of place and the path cost to determine the total cost.
