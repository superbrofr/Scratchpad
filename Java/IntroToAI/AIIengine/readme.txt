Features:
  Truth-Table Checking: Uses the knowledge base and the asked symbol to determine how many models of the knowledge base would support the asked symbol being true.
  Forward Chaining: uses a forward chaining algorithm to determine whether the asked symbol is entailed in the knowledge base by making inferences of the known knowledge until the asked symbol is found or no knew knowledge can be inferred.
  Backward Chaining: uses a backward chaining algorithm to determine whether the asked symbol is entailed in the knowledge base by searching for other symbols which would support the asked symbol being true, and working backwards to determine if those supporting symbols are entailed in the knowledge base (and if symbols supporting the supporting symbols are entailed etc.).
